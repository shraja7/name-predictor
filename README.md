# Next.js App Router Test

This is a simple testing application built with Next.js to explore the usage of the app router. It provides a basic demonstration of fetching data from external APIs and displaying the results on a page. The application predicts age, gender, and nationality based on a given name using external APIs (Agify, Genderize, and Nationalize).

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications. It provides powerful features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and routing out of the box.

- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application state.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes to quickly build responsive and customizable UI components.

## Learned

During the development of this application, the following concepts and techniques were learned:

- Setting up a Next.js application with the necessary dependencies and folder structure.
- Configuring routes and creating dynamic routes using Next.js app router.
- Utilizing the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to handle navigation and access the route parameters.
- Understanding the difference between server-side rendering and client-side rendering in Next.js.
- Fetching data asynchronously in Next.js server components by making them client components using the `useEffect` hook.
